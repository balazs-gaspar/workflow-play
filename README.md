## Key Features

- **Workflow Management**: Track workflows from creation to completion
- **Task Management**: Manage tasks with dependencies and assignments
- **Team Collaboration**: Assign tasks to team members and track progress
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor workflow and task statuses in real-time
- **Recommendation System**: POC for intelligent task and resource recommendations
